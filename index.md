# Step 2: Create a github repository and upload files

Next step you will go to github and `create a new repository.` 

You can name the repository what you would like, but `make sure that the repository is public`

After creating your new repository, under the quick setup section select **upload an existing file**. `Choose the markdown file you have created.`

# Step 3: Make the markdown page the source
After uploading your markdown file you will see that github has already made some changes to document. 

Next you need to head to settings section on github. This is found on the top bar all the right on the side. 


After entering settings, scroll all the way to the bottom to the section **Github Pages**. 

Select `master branch` as the `Source` option. 

You can also choose a cool theme for your website. Just click on `Choose a theme` then pick just click the `Select theme` button to apply that theme to your repository. 

# Step 4: Your website is live!
To view your new website, click the link under the github pages section. 

You can now view your live website!!!
